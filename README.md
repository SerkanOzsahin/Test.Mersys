**Our Internship Journey:** This project was created with the aim of providing us, as interns, with hands-on experience using essential technologies such as Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber. During the course of this project, we improved our skills in web automation, test management, and behavior-driven development. Additionally, completing this project has helped us gain a deeper understanding of software development processes and how to manage a project from start to finish.

**Strengthening Team Communication:** Throughout our internship journey, we not only gained valuable technical skills but also learned the importance of effective team communication. We focused on enhancing collaboration and building stronger team bonds, which were essential for the success of our project.
